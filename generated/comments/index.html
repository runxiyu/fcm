		<p>I agree that complicated components such as processors can be problematic as they are very often very difficult to review, change and fabricate but I don't align with it being a reason to consider Free Hardware Designs ("FHD") as not worthy of supporting, because as long as the designs are GPLv3-compatible then they can be changed to use more appropriate components.</p>

	<p>Yup.  As a side note, it's like there are free software developers who also distribute binary packages.  The binary packages themselves are hard to review and modify, but that's not a reason to be against free software.</p>
	<p>However, making hardware that we can use is not as simple as putting the design through a compiler.  Therefore we urge hardware manufacturers to adopt FGPAs and modular designs.</p>
