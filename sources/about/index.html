	<h2>The Origin of this Movement</h2>
	<p><a href="https://fsf.org">The&nbsp;Free&nbsp;Software&nbsp;Foundation</a>&nbsp;is a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom.  However, as we've discussed in <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2022-01/msg00102.html">an email thread</a> via <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/libreplanet-discuss">LibrePlanet-discuss</a>, merely having free software doesn't give us the freedom we deserve.  This Website serves as a discussion platform to us activists.</p>

	<p>We can't make free software, especially bootloaders and operating systems, if we don't have knowledge of how hardware works.  In modern day computing we do understand how to design kernels for most architectures such as x86 and aarch64, but this is not enough&mdash;without extensive research into how components in a specific peice of hardware interact with each other, we may be able to accomplish simple tasks such as running an OS on it, but <a href="https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/fight-to-repair">the right to repair</a> is severely restricted.</p>
