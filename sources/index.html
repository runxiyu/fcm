	<p><strong>The Free Computing Movement (FCM) is a community with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. We defend the rights of all computer users.</strong></p>
	<h2>What is the Free Computing Movement?</h2>
	<p><a href="https://fsf.org">The Free Software Foundation</a> is a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom.  However, as we've discussed in <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2022-01/msg00102.html">an email thread</a> via <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/libreplanet-discuss">LibrePlanet-discuss</a>, merely having free software doesn't give us the freedom we deserve.  This Websites aims to serve as a discussion platform for us activists.</p>
	<p>The FSF already does a good job in free <em>software</em>.  This Website is mainly for posts on free <em>hardware</em>.</p>

        <h2>The Origin of this Movement</h2>
        <p><a href="https://fsf.org">The&nbsp;Free&nbsp;Software&nbsp;Foundation</a>&nbsp;is a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom.  However, as we've discussed in <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2022-01/msg00102.html">an email thread</a> via <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/libreplanet-discuss">LibrePlanet-discuss</a>, merely having free software doesn't give us the freedom we deserve.

        <blockquote>
                <p>In fact, access to schematics, boardviews, datasheets and any other documentation is <em>critical</em> to software freedom.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>We can't make free software, especially bootloaders and operating systems, if we don't have knowledge of how hardware works.  In modern day computing we do understand how to design kernels for most architectures such as x86 and aarch64, but this is not enough&mdash;without extensive research into how components in a specific peice of hardware interact with each other, we may be able to accomplish simple tasks such as running an OS on it, but <a href="https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/fight-to-repair">the right to repair</a> is severely restricted.</p>

<div id="what-is-free-hardware">
	<h2>What is Free Hardware?</h2>
	<p>Hardware that meets the following conditions are free hardware.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The design files, for example 3D models and circuit diagrams, are available under a free license;</li>
		<li>The documentations of interfaces of the hardware, such as data sheets, are available under a free license;</li>
		<li>The hardware is fully functional with no proprietary software;</li>
		<li>The hardware is designed to be easy to tinker around with (including improving and reparing, e.g. being modular) and contains no tivoization.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Here, a free license means that the user may use, adapt and/or redistribute the work for any purpose, similar to the four essential freedoms of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-can-i-help">
	<h2>How Can I Help?</h2>
	<h3>Users</h3>
	<p>If you're just a normal computer user, kindly ask the manufacturer of your hardware for design files and datasheets.  Show manufacturer that you care about your freedom to hack the hardware.</p>
	<p>When considering purchasing new hardware, prioritize free hardware.  At this stage it is extremely rare to find any, but still be on the lookout.  Please, if you find any that seem to be trustworthy, tell the community about it.</p>
	<h3>Hardware manufacturers</h3>
	<p>When you create a hardware design, use the <a href="https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.txt">the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal</a> license!  It is a strong copyleft license for hardware designs and documentation, similar to the spirit of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt">GNU General Public License</a> widely used in software.  This ensures that it is illegal to take your design and make proprietary hardware out of it.</p>
	<p>If you're wondering how you could profit, see <a href="#faq-profit">the FAQ on profits</a>.</p>

<div id="faq">
	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<h3 id="faq-profit">What would be the incentive for hardware manufacturers to continue develop hardware and innovate?</h3>
	<p>You may profit from providing support to end users who don't know how to deal with hardware..</p>
	<p>However, is profit your goal of developing hardware?  When profit is the goal of a project or company, people often ignore the social consequences they bring about to people.  <a href="https://project.andrewyu.org/libresociety">Profit is not essential, or good, for the development of anything.</a></p>
	<h3 id="development-cost">How would developers gather the resources to develop hardware?  Developing hardware is expensive.</h3>
	<p>This is an issue.  However, people in the free software community&mdash;who probably also support free hardware&mdash;would probably be more than happy to support you.</p>
	<p>It should be noted that many or most of the expenses of developing hardware today comes from patents.  All patents must be abolished for the same reason as <a href="https://endsoftwarepatents.org">software patents</a>.</p>
	<h3 id="faq-collective-control">How would this affect me, a normal computer user who doesn't understand how my hardware works?</h3>
	<p>There are almost certainlly people who would understand how the hardware works, and possibly tinker with it, given free documentation, design files and datasheets.  It is impossible for everyone to be a computer expert;  however, free hardware and free software grant people collective control over their computing, with the freedom to redistribute modified version of the original work.</p>

	<h2>Read the EULAs!</h2>
	<p>Please tell people around you who are not already involved in free software to read the EULAs before accepting (or rather, rejecting) their programs and (dis-)services!  Let people understand what big tech does to them.</p>
