	<h2>What is the Free Computing Movement?</h2>
	<p><strong>The Free Computing Movement (FCM) is a <em>community of activists</em> with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom.  We defend the rights of all computer users&mdash;to know what their computers are doing, and to modify and redistribute software and hardware designs at will.</strong></p>
	<!--How do we defend?  By educating them that there are free sw/hw alternatives to proprietary malwawre that people use.-->
	<p>The Free Computing Movement promotes free software and free hardware designs.</p>
